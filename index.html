        <p>Computer programming is the process of performing particular computations
             (or more generally, accomplishing specific computing results), usually by designing and 
             building executable computer programs. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
              algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of 
              algorithms (usually in a particular programming language, commonly referred to as coding).
              The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible
               to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing
                unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
                 performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often
                  for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several
                   different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms,
                    and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging,
             source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management
              of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. However,
               while these might be considered part of the programming process, often the term 
               software development is more likely used for this larger overall process â€“ whereas 
               the terms programming, implementation, and coding tend to be focused on the actual
                writing of code. Relatedly, software engineering combines engineering techniques and principles
                 with software development. Also, those involved with software development may at times engage 
                 in reverse engineering, which is the practice of seeking to understand an existing program so
                  as to re-implement its function in some way.
